## Age-conditional risk prediction

This project includes the R code for the following types of predictions:
1. Age-conditional risk estimation given incidence rate ratio, current age and period of follow-up. Can also be used to compute lifetime risk.     

2. Calculating the odds ratio as compared to the general population.

3. Converting prevalence odds ratio (POR) to lifetime relative risk.
